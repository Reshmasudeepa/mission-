This task implements a simple backend search API using Node.js without any external frameworks. Product data is stored in a local JSON file and treated as mock backend data. The POST /products/search endpoint accepts optional filters such as category, minimum price, maximum price, and inStockOnly. Incoming request data is validated carefully, and meaningful error responses are returned when inputs are invalid, including a check that minPrice does not exceed maxPrice.

To handle messy or incomplete data from the JSON file, products are normalized before filtering. Prices and stock values are converted to numbers where possible, and missing values are safely treated as null. The filtering logic then applies each valid filter step by step to return only matching products along with a total count. The code is structured into small helper functions for clarity and maintainability. In a real production system, this API could be expanded with pagination, sorting, and database-backed storage instead of reading from a file.
